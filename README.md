Here's a basic PowerShell script (ps1) to help push new projects to GitHub. This script assumes that you already have Git installed, and you are authenticated to GitHub with the required permissions.

Steps to Use
- Replace placeholders (YourRepositoryName, C:\Path\To\Your\Project, YourGitHubUsername, YourGitHubToken) with your actual details.
- Save this script as a .ps1 file (e.g., PushToGitHub.ps1).
- Run the script using PowerShell.
- Make sure to run from project folder.
